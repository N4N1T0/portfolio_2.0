  "challenge": "To develop a user experience that simulates the luxury aesthetic and refined movement of high-end design agencies, while maintaining excellent performance. The key challenge was orchestrating complex GSAP-driven animations (preloader, slider, text reveal with SplitText) and managing a clean, secure email flow using Astro Actions.",
  "solution": "The platform was built using Astro for static speed and integrated GSAP with `CustomEase` and `SplitText` to precisely handle all motion interactions. The design centered on a 'Minimal Slider' with wheel/touch navigation, and a clean contact flow was implemented using Astro Actions and the Resend API for secure email delivery.",
